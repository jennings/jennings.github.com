I was happy with:

* Found a way to reduce by half the number of controllers we have to keep track
  of.

* I think I can make the argument tomorrow that this should be merged into the
  mainline.

* Found a way to introduce testable code into this project.

I wasn't satisfied with:

* I asked for advice of the form, "is this the right way to go about doing
  this?" and didn't feel like I was properly expressing the type of advice I
  wanted.
